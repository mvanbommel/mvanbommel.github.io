			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Currently I am in my final year of the master's program in the <a href="https://www.stat.sfu.ca/">Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science</a> at <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a> where I work with <a href="http://www.lukebornn.com/">Luke Bornn</a>. My research focuses on machine learning and spatio-temporal modeling with applications in basketball analytics. My first project was titled <a href="http://www.sloansportsconference.com/?p=17518">The Van Exel Effect: Adjusting for Scorekeeper Bias in NBA Box Scores</a> and was featured as a poster presentation at the 2016 <a href="http://www.sloansportsconference.com/">MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference</a>. </p>

			<p>Before coming to SFU, I obtained a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics at <a href="http://www2.acadiau.ca/">Acadia University</a>. There I worked with <a href="http://www.acadiau.ca/~hchipman/">Hugh Chipman</a>, <a href="http://www.acadiau.ca/~pranjan/">Pritam Ranjan</a>, and <a href="http://math.acadiau.ca/RichardKarsten.html">Richard Karsten</a> using Gaussian Process models to model potential energy generation surfaces of tidal energy turbines placed in the Minas Passage in the Bay of Fundy. This research resulted in my <a href="http://openarchive.acadiau.ca/cdm/singleitem/collection/HTheses/id/1153/rec/1">undergraduate thesis</a>.</p>
