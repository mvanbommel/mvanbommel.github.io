      <h1>Sacramento Police Dispatch Data App</h1>
      <p>
        <em>Posted: August 5, 2019</em>
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="linked-header" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to create an interactive application allowing users to gain
        insight into the <a
          href="http://data.cityofsacramento.org/datasets/9efe7653009b448f8d177c1da0cc068f_0">Sacramento
        Police Department Dispatch Data</a> available on the
        City of Sacramento <a href="http://data.cityofsacramento.org/">Open Data Portal</a>. While
        it is fantastic that the city makes the data publicly
        available, it is very difficult to gain any insight into the data, especially for someone
        who may not be technically inclined. Thus, hopefully the app
        can bridge the gap between the data and the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app was created using the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> package in <a
          href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. The map makes
        use of the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">Leaflet</a> package. The data is
        pulled via an <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/">ArcGIS REST API</a> using a <a
          href="https://github.com/mvanbommel/esri2sf">fork</a> of
        the <a href="https://github.com/yonghah/esri2sf">esri2sf</a> package.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code for the project is available on <a
          href="https://github.com/mvanbommel/SacCrimeData">GitHub</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app is currently live and can be viewed at <a
          href="https://mvanbommel.shinyapps.io/SacCrimeData/">mvanbommel.shinyapps.io/SacCrimeData</a>
      </p>
      
      
      <h2 class="linked-header" id="design">Design</h2>
      <p>
        The basic design makes use of the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/">shinydashboard</a>
        package. The main body of the page is the
        map showing the locations of the filtered dispatch calls, highlighting spatial element of
        the data. The map includes both a high
        level overview of the location
        distribution (via the heatmap) and detailed information on individual calls (via the
        markers). The dashboard sidebar is then free to be used for
        inputs to filter the data displayed on the map, and can be collapsed to provide additional
        space for the map. In addition to the collapsible sidebar,
        Shiny uses <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to present a responsive design,
        allowing the app to look good on a variety of screen sizes.
      </p>

      <h5>Open Data Difficulties</h5>
      <p>
        Working with the open data set caused several difficulties throughout the process. First,
        there is little documentation that I could find, leaving me
        to guess, infer, and Google my way through much of the process. I was not even able to find
        descriptions of the variables. Further, whenever
        something changed with the data set (outlined in the next paragraph) there appeared to be no
        records or notice indicating such.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, the data set changed over the course of the development of the app. Previously, there
        had been several 'time' columns (Received Time, En Route
        Time, At Scene Time, etc.) outlining the time of progress throughout the police response.
        However, at some point these columns were removed, and the
        time information was lost. Thus, while I had been creating a visualization to display and
        interact with response times, I had to remove it once the
        information stopped being provided. Additionally, column name and order changes forced me to
        continually edit the code to keep everything functioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, sometimes the API used to access the data stops working. Once I realized this was
        an artifact of the API itself and not caused by my code,
        it forced me to add a backup option - a saved data set that could be accessed at times the
        API stopped functioning.
      </p>
      
      <h5>Customizing Leaflet</h5>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> is an open-source JavaScript library for
        creating interactive and highly customizable maps. The <a
          href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">Leaflet R package</a> does an excellent job at
        bringing many of the features of Leaflet into the R
        environment (especially when combined with the <a
          href="https://bhaskarvk.github.io/leaflet.extras/">leaflet.extras</a> package), but of
        course it will
        have its limitations. One such limitation I encountered was using the draw toolbar, without
        treating the drawings as layers. Treating the drawings as
        layers is the expected behaviour, however it did not provide the functionality I needed.
        Thus, since no layers were being created, the delete button
        in the draw toolbar was always disabled, even when there were drawn shapes that could
        have been deleted, as shown in the screenshot below.
      </p>
      <div class="container">
        <figure class="figure">
          <img src="../images/leaflet_disabled_delete.png" class="img-fluid"
               alt="Disabled Leaflet Delete Button">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">The disabled Leaflet delete button</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>
        To get around this limitation, I had to hijack the button's functionality using JavaScript.
        Specifically, I use the jQuery <a
          href=https://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/"><code>replaceWith()</code></a> method to replace
        the Leaflet button with my own custom button. The exact
        function I used was:
      </p>
      <pre><code>  function changeDeleteButton() {
    // If leaflet delete button is present, replace it with custom button
    if ( $( "a.leaflet-draw-edit-remove" ).length ) {
      $( "a.leaflet-draw-edit-remove" ).replaceWith( "&lt;button class='delete-button' title='Clear Rectangle'&gt; &lt;/button&gt;" );
    }
  }</code></pre>
      <p>
        I then used custom CSS to style the button and made use of Shiny's ability to <a
          href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/communicating-with-js.html">communicate via
        JavaScript</a> to create a new input value and change its
        value whenever the button is pressed, using the JavaScript functions:
      </p>
      
      <pre><code>  $( document ).on("shiny:sessioninitialized", function(event) {
    Shiny.setInputValue("clear_rectangle", "FALSE");
  });
        
  $(document).on('click tap', '.delete-button', function () {
    // When delete button is clicked, change input$clear_rectangle to TRUE
    Shiny.setInputValue("clear_rectangle", "TRUE");
  });
  
  Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler('resetInput', function(variableName) {
    // Set input variable to NULL
    Shiny.setInputValue(variableName, null);
  });</code></pre>
      
      <p>
        Along with the Shiny code:
      </p>
      
      
      <pre><code>  observeEvent(input$clear_rectangle, {
    if (input$clear_rectangle == 'TRUE') {
      session$sendCustomMessage(type = "resetInput", message = "clear_rectangle")
    }
  })</code></pre>
      
      <p>
        which invokes the CustomMessageHandler defined above. The result of all this code, is a
        customized, enabled delete button in the draw toolbar:
      </p>
      <div class="container">
        <figure class="figure">
          <img src="../images/leaflet_enabled_delete.png" class="img-fluid"
               alt="Custom Enabled Leaflet Delete Button">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">The custom enabled Leaflet delete button</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      
      
      <h5>Querying the API</h5>
      <p>
        All data in the app (with the exception of the backup in case the API is down) is queried
        from an ArcGIS REST API. Constructing the queries was a
        learning process and while there is some <a
          href="https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/query-feature-service-.htm">documentation</a>,
        much of the process involved trial and error. Since the inputs and filters are interactive,
        I also had to programmatically construct the queries,
        based on the user selected values.
      </p>
      <p>
        A huge help in the querying process was the <a href="https://github.com/yonghah/esri2sf">esri2sf</a>
        package. The package takes a query, retrieves
        the corresponding JSON from the API, and then converts the result to a data frame. I then
        edited the package to allow for limits and offsets to also
        be passed to the API. The limit parameter defines how many results (rows) to return, while
        the offset parameter defines the number of results (rows)
        to skip. Thus a query with a limit of 100 and an offset of 0 will have distinct results from
        a query with a limit of 100 and an offset of 100. Since
        the API limits the number of results returned to 1000, these additional
        parameters add control over exactly which results are
        returned. The edited package is available for download on <a
          href="https://github.com/mvanbommel/esri2sf">GitHub</a> or can be installed in R using the
        command: <code>install_github(repo = "mvanbommel/esri2sf")</code> from the <a
          href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes//">remotes
      </a> package.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="linked-header" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The app took much longer to develop than I originally anticipated. I began with overly
        ambitious ideas and plans, and once I decided
        to simplify the app to its core components, the development process went much more smoothly.
        I also changed much more than I originally anticipated
        after soliciting some initial feedback. With a fairly simple app, I figured it would be easy
        to make intuitive decisions and that any feedback would
        be minor. However, the value of outside opinions quickly became obvious and I believe the
        app improved significantly because of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I am quite pleased with the end product. I believe the app is elegant and
        functional, and greatly improves the accessibility and
        interactivity of the data presented. If you have not taken a look yet, be sure to go play
        around with the <a
          href="https://mvanbommel.shinyapps.io/SacCrimeData/">live app</a> or to download the <a
          href="https://github.com/mvanbommel/SacCrimeData">source
        code</a>. If you arrive at any interesting insights or conclusions from the data, be sure to
        share them with me! And also feel free to reach out with any
        feedback you have to help improve the app even further.
