      <h1>Creating This Website</h1>
      <p>
        <em>Posted: April 14, 2019 (Edited: April 21, 2019)</em>
      </p>
      
      
      <h2 class="linked-header" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I have had a personal website since 2016 when I realized that not only was <a
          href="https://www.matthewvanbommel.com/">matthewvanbommel.com</a> still
        available,
        but I could own it for just $10 a year! Combined with the realization that I could host the
        site on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub
        Pages</a> for free, it became a no-brainer to have a personal website. Since then, my site
        has gone through several design iterations, none of which I
        have been entirely satisfied with. Given that dissatisfaction, and an increased interest in
        building web applications, I decided to do a complete
        redesign of my website, building it from the ground up. This task felt intimidating for
        someone whose previous web development experience
        consisted
        entirely of a "How Websites Work" course in my college undergrad and editing templates to
        build previous iterations of this website, thus I set out
        with realistic goals in mind:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Learn about HTML, CSS, and web design, and improve my skills in those domains</li>
        <li>Create a functioning website (and hopefully make it look decent)</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        A portion of the code used in this project is available on <a
          href="https://github.com/mvanbommel/nba_scorekeeper_bias">GitHub</a>. More detailed
        accounts of this project are linked in the <a href="#publications">Publications Section</a>
        below.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="linked-header" id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h2>
      <p>
        One of the first decisions I made is that I would be using the <a
          href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. Bootstrap was originally
        created at Twitter and is now one of the most popular front-end frameworks, while being
        completely open source. Bootstrap emphasizes responsive web
        design, allowing websites to look good across a variety of screen sizes and devices: a near
        necessity in today's digital age. Having created <a
          href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a>
        apps, I was also a little familiar with the basic concepts of Bootstrap,
        specifically the grid system that underlies the basic design structure. Getting up and
        running with Bootstrap was pretty straightforward using this
        <a href="http://bootstrap.themes.guide/how-to.html">tutorial</a> to understand the basic
        concepts and making use of its
        excellent <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/">documentation</a>
        to fill in any gaps.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        On the whole, I found Bootstrap to be fairly intuitive, and pretty good at helping to scale
        design to different devices - certainly incredibly simple
        compared to the alternative of building everything from scratch myself. However I did have
        one major Bootstrap related headache during this process.
        The official Bootstrap website has some great <a
          href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/">examples</a> of some of the different
        features
        and styles you can implement. As such, I was using the <a
          href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/dashboard/">dashboard</a> example to
        figure out how to add the sidebar (not displayed on mobile) and though I appeared to
        completely mirror the code, it
        looked different on my site than it did in the example. After a lot of search and much
        confusion, I finally realized that I was using an outdated
        version of Bootstrap - I was using v3 (thanks to copying and pasting a Stack Overflow
        snippet) while the example was using the up to date v4.
        Thankful to
        have finally found
        the
        source of the issue, I updated
        my references to v4, only to have my site look completely different than it did in v3.
        Despite my defeated feeling and my decision to give up for the
        night, bringing the site back to its previous glory proved a fairly simple task thanks to
        Bootstrap's excellent <a
          href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/">migration documentation</a>. Aside
        from that mix-up, it was fairly smooth sailing with
        Bootstrap (at least relative to the rest of my struggles) and I certainly recommend it to
        someone building their own responsive website.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="linked-header" id="design">Design</h2>
      <p>
        The overall structure of the page follows a fairly standard Bootstrap layout: a <a
          href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar/">navbar
      </a> at the top, followed by the content, and a footer at the bottom - with an additional
        sidebar on the content pages for screens with a wide enough
        view. The navbar and sidebar are both fixed - meaning they maintain constant position on the
        screen as the user scrolls. Finally, the home page makes
        use of a full page background image, which scales to fill the screen regardless of its
        dimensions.
      </p>
      
      <h5>Responsiveness</h5>
      <p>
        Bootstrap makes a lot of aspects of responsive design straightforward. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>columns are automatically resized so that the full width of the screen is used</li>
        <li>columns placed side-by-side are stacked vertically when the screen display size is below
          a defined width
        </li>
        <li>images scale in size with the screen dimensions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I added a few additional components of responsive design. The main image on the homepage
        switches depending on the screen ratio: wide screens present
        an image of a court stretching east to west while tall screens present a court spanning
        north to south. In a similar vein, narrow screens have no
        sidebar displayed on the content pages to maximize screen real estate. The navbar icons are
        also moved to a dropdown menu on narrow screens to ensure
        they never span the entire screen width and overlap the home button.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was surprised to learn that Bootstrap
        does not include a method to adjust font size as the screen dimension changes, however I was
        able to accomplish this feature using the
        <code>calc()</code> function as presented in this <a
          href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/fluid-typography/">guide</a> on fluid
        typography. I
        opted for a minimum font size of 16px that stretches all the way up to 24px for larger
        displays. These sizes are much larger than I originally
        anticipated, but were strongly supported in this <a
          href="https://learnui.design/blog/mobile-desktop-website-font-size-guidelines.html">guide</a>.
        One gem from the guide: the publishing platform <a
          href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> has a default text size of 21px! When text is the
        main feature of a site, making sure it is easy to read is of
        critical importance.
      </p>
      
      <h5>Colour</h5>
      <p>
        Given that the majority of content on this site is going to be text based posts or
        descriptions of projects, I tried to emphasize readability in my
        choices for the end design: thus the dark gray text on a white background. For continuity, I
        repeated the same shade of gray for the header and
        footer, inverting the text and icons to white. Hopefully the result is a clean and simple
        design that doesn't distract or remove any attention from
        the actual content.
      </p>
      
      <div class="container">
        <figure class="figure">
          <img alt="Black Home Page" class="img-fluid" src="../images/black_homepage.png">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">A previous iteration of the home page.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        The final emphasis on readability is a stark contrast to the inverted (white text on black
        background) initial design I selected. There are many things I like about inverted designs:
        they stand out and can look super slick if done well.
        I especially liked the aesthetic on the home page of this site. However, in researching best
        practices for dark design, I found a <a
          href="https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/">few</a> <a
          href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/08/the-dos-and-donts-of-dark-web-design/">articles</a>
        that talked me down from a dark design, to
        something more traditional, and I think the decision improved the final product.
      </p>
      
      
      <h5>Icons</h5>
      <p>
        Most companies make it very easy to use their logos to link to their websites. I found brand
        resource pages for the three external links
        in my
        navigation bar (<a href="https://github.com/logos">GitHub</a>, <a
          href="https://about.twitter.com/en_us/company/brand-resources.html">Twitter</a>,
        and <a href="https://brand.linkedin.com/visual-identity/logo">LinkedIn</a>) where I could
        download the logos with transparent backgrounds. Additional
        icons (like on the project boxes on the homepage) were obtained from <a
          href="https://icons8.com/">Icons8</a> - a great library of icons that even
        lets you edit the colors and backgrounds for many of them.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="linked-header" id="lessons">Lessons</h2>
      <h5>Chrome's Inspect Tool</h5>
      <p>
        Google Chrome's <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/">DevTools</a> are a set of
        tools built into Chrome (other browsers have
        similar toolsets). I knew about DevTools before I started this project but I did not know
        how powerful they could be. Some highlights include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>simulating mobile devices (and other screen sizes) to see how a website will appear in
          different environments
        </li>
        <li>determining the size, padding, and margins of different components</li>
        <li>figuring out exactly which styling elements are impacting a component, and determining
          the source for each element
        </li>
        <li>live testing of HTML and CSS changes, without editing your actual source code</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project involved many hours spent using DevTools, and while progress was quite slow at
        first, I have drastically increased my skills in using
        the tools and tracking down errors throughout the process.
      </p>
      
      <h5>Styles Ordering</h5>
      <p>
        At the start of this project, I naively put no thought into the ordering of style elements
        (including placing the reference to Bootstrap's stylesheet
        after the reference to my custom stylesheet and being confused when I could not alter
        Bootstrap styles). However, several experiences have taught me
        that the ordering of styles is crucial, most simply because if multiple styles conflict,
        priority is given to the last style applied.
      </p>
      
      <h5>The Important Keyword</h5>
      <p>
        At one stage, I could not figure out how to override a particular Bootstrap style with my
        own custom styling. After a quick search, I came across the
        <code>!important</code> keyword, which can be added to a line of styling to give it priority
        (ignoring the order of styles) - an excellent solution!
        Soon my stylesheet grew filled with <code>!important</code> keywords to solve all sorts of
        styling issues. At this point I looked at my stylesheet
        and thought "this cannot be good practice". Further searching confirmed that thought. Sure,
        I had accomplished the desired results, but using a
        sort of 'cheat code' that would complicate future development. Removing all
        <code>!important</code> keywords involved finding the actual causes of
        the conflicts, and determining the correct way to resolve them. This corrective process
        resulted in a deeper understanding of the codebase and
        facilitated easier future changes.
      </p>
      
      <h5>Media Queries</h5>
      <p>
        CSS <code>@media</code> queries return information about the device accessing your website
        and thus allow the content to be altered depending on factors including
        the type, size, or orientation of the device. Bootstrap uses <code>@media</code> queries in
        creating responsive design and it is straightforward to add
        additional custom <code>@media</code> queries. This site uses <code>@media</code> queries to
        determine the orientation of the court on the homepage and whether to display the
        sidebar.
      </p>
      
      <h5>Sidebar Links</h5>
      <p>
        Linking to a section (in my case a header) on a page is fairly straightforward through the
        use of an <code>id</code>. However, the links move the
        header of interest to
        the very top of the page, which is directly behind my fixed navbar. Thus I needed a solution
        to move the header of interest to just below the top of
        the page. I was pleased to realize that padding proved to be a fairly elegant solution to
        this issue: padding does not change the starting point of a
        header, so the links would lead to the top of the padding rather than where the text begins.
        As such, I was able to fix the issue using the
        following class:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
  .linked-header {
      padding-top: 45px; /* Height of navbar */
      padding-bottom: 20px; /* Add padding on bottom to even it out a bit */
  }
        </code>
      </pre>
      
      <h5>Different Browsers and Operating Systems</h5>
      <p>
        Different browsers can display the same website differently, which is why I was sure to test
        my site with several common browsers. I installed <a
          href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>, <a
          href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>, and <a
          href="https://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> locally on the Linux machine I used during
        development. I was able to test <a
          href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge">Edge</a> on the same machine
        by using the free Edge testing offer from <a
          href="https://www.browserstack.com/test-on-microsoft-edge-browser">BrowserStack</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I knew before I began this project that it would be important to test the results
        across browsers, I did not realize it is also important to
        test across operating systems. Even keeping the browser constant, sites can be displayed
        differently across operating systems. For example, the icons
        in my navbar looked great in Chrome on both Linux and Windows, but were stretched out when
        viewed on a Mac. Typically, you need either access to
        copies of each operating system you want to test or a willingness to pay for a service (like
        BrowserStack mentioned above) that can generate virtual
        environments of browser and operating system combinations. However, I discovered the free <a
          href="http://browsershots.org/">Browser Shots</a> site,
        which is able to capture screenshots of a site from a variety of browsers and operating
        systems. While the service has its restrictions (no ability
        to live test, slow generation of screen shots, limited number of tests per day) it can be a
        great way to perform a quick test without spending any
        money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopefully, I have been able to catch all the inconsistencies across browsers and operating
        systems, but there is certainly a possibility a bug has
        slipped through the cracks. So if you notice anything that you think might look a little off
        with this site, be sure to let me know!
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="linked-header" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Reflecting on my two stated goals from the introduction, I have no doubt that I vastly
        increased my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and web design throughout
        the process of creating this website and I succeeded in creating a functional website (which
        I would say looks at least half decent, if not all the
        way there). I also gained a lot of appreciation for front end development, UX design, and UI
        design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Would I recommend the process of building a website from the ground up? For most people, the
        answer would be no. This process took much more time
        than I originally anticipated, much of it spent either staring at DevTools trying to figure
        out why the change I made did not actually change
        anything or searching through Stack Overflow in search of someone with an identical (or at
        least similar enough) situation. Given the huge variety of
        website building tools and templates out there, if your main goal is simply to create a
        website, you can get a lot more for a lot less work by not
        starting from scratch. But if your goal is to increase your knowledge of web design or the
        tools associated with it and you are realistic about the
        time commitment, then building your own website can be a great option. For me, building a
        website presented a similar problem solving aspect to
        traditional coding but the methods to solve those problems were often drastically different
        and required a new way of thinking. Solving these
        problems certainly became easier as I moved further along the process and the end result of
        getting a new component functioning or looking how I
        wanted was at times incredibly rewarding.

        Finally, I want to stress that this website is still a work in progress. So if you see
        something that does not appear to be functioning how it
        should, or have any ideas or suggestions on how it can be improved, feel free to reach out
        to me! You can find my contact information in the footer
        at the bottom of the page.
