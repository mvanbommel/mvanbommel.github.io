        <em>Posted: March 23, 2019</em>

      <h2 class="linked-header" id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/842.The_Psychology_of_Everyday_Things">The Psychology of Everyday Things</a> by Donald A. Norman
        discusses design in our world and how to optimize user experiences. Originally published in 1988, later revisions have the title <a
          href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things">The Design of Everyday Things</a> and have been updated as recently as
        2013. Norman is a cognitive scientist and usability engineer and the book presents his thoughts and experiences with design - particularly
        methods for improvement and optimization. While this book mostly focuses on the design of objects in the physical world, I read it from the perspective
        of a designer of digital tools and interfaces and found myself able to take away many of the lessons discussed.

      <h2 class="linked-header" id="key_takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
      <h5>Human behaviour is not always rational.</h5>
      <p>
        The fact that human behaviour can be irrational should not be a surprise to anyone who has ever done something and not been able to explain why.
        While it is appealing to imagine users behaving
        rationally at all times when using a system or application, that simply is not an accurate depiction. As such, a designer can never predict how users
        will
        act, and thus systems must be designed in light of this lack of predictability. One important technique resulting from this reality is to:
      </p>
      
      <h5>Design for error.</h5>
      <p>
        Since humans do not always behave rationally, they are bound to make mistakes. As such, systems should be designed not only to help minimize the
        likelihood of those mistakes but also to make it easy to recover from them. This latter point hit home with me, both from my experiences as a user
        and as a designer. In a well designed system, a user should be able to explore and experiment without fear of irreversible negative consequences. In
        addition to affording a user more ease when using a system, it also allows them to discover new techniques or features that may have remained hidden
        had they been hesitant to explore and try new things.
      </p>
      
      <h5>Put required knowledge in the world.</h5>
      <p>
        While it is tempting to plan to "teach" users how to operate a system (especially when you can count your users on one hand), all required
        information should be present in the system itself. If an action requires user memory, it is only a matter of time before a user misremembers or
        outright forgets. The other side of this coin is to not let all of this information slow down operation, especially for experienced users. For example,
        while presenting a tutorial is great for a first time user, it would be aggravating for an experienced user to have to proceed through a tutorial
        each time they wanted to use the system.
      </p>
      
      <h5>Make things visible</h5>
      <p>
        Visibility applies to both options and functions. Rather than hiding features in favour of a more "elegant" design, let users see all the available
        options. Then, when a user makes a decision, make the results of each action obvious.
      </p>
      
      <h5>Avoid creeping featurism.</h5>
      <p>
        It's always tempting to add one new feature or one new element, but eventually those single additions add up to be a bloated system. Knowing when to
        stop, whether stopping is splitting a system into multiple parts or simply avoiding non-essential features, is a key design skill
      </p>
      
      <h5>Use natural mappings.</h5>
      <p>
        While more prevalent in the physical world, natural mappings can also extend to the digital realm. A natural mapping is an intuitive
        relationship between an action and the result (ie. turning the top of a steering wheel right turns a vehicle to the right). The most common natural
        mappings are physical analogies, but design standards (like a floppy disk icon to represent a "save" action) can also serve as natural mappings. The key
        here is
        to
        reduce
        the
        thought required by the user and to make their experience as seamless as possible.

        Given its publication date, many of the examples and case studies presented in this book are quite dated. Automatic faucets are
        presented as the cusp of innovation and significant attention is devoted to telephone systems. However, the vast majority of the principles presented
        apply to a wide variety of design situations and the book does an excellent job of bringing to the forefront the experience of a user - a relatable
        experience for everyone. Finally, the main message of the book - "make operation simple for the user" - is more applicable than
        ever given the possibilities presented by the technology of today.
